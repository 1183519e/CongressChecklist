# CongressChecklist
===================

List of things to do, to pack and tips on attending a congress, especially Chaos Communication Congress

---


## Things to do before travelling

- Charge ALL the batteries!  

 
## Securing your devices

### Backups
Make fresh backups of ALL the devices you bring to CCCongress.

### BIOS/EFI Password
Make sure you do have set a BIOS or EFI Password to prevent booting from a live CD to attack your system.

### Full disk encryption
Activate full disk encryption with pre-boot authentication. (Mac: Activate FileVault.)

### VPN tunnel
Have at least one trusted, working and tested VPN endpoint available for tunneling out of the congress network.  

- OpenVPN
- L2TP/IPSec
- SSH
- iodine (DNS tunnel for those pesky for-pay captive portal WiFi networks)
- Tor/Vidalia



## Things to pack

### Documents
- Train/plane tickets (including verification documents for self-printed DB tickets, like your credit card or Personalausweis)
- Congress tickets (printed or in iOS 6 passbook)
- Passport or other kind of photo ID (Personalausweis)
- Driver's license (even an international one)
- Hotel booking
- Ham radio license


### Payment stuff
- Some cash (€uros)
- CreditCard
- Coins (€uros, for automated vending machines, like public transport tickets)
- Bitcoin wallet


### Gear
- Laptop (with a working battery)
- Charger for Laptop
- Mac: Small Duck-head and long (Schuko Plug) cord
- Mac: MagSafe to MagSafe 2 Adapter
- 3* or 5* Extension (230V≈ @50Hz) with Schuko Plug (and optional switch)
- Simple extension cord (230V @50Hz, Schuko Plug)
- USB Sticks
	- Put an OWNER.txt file on them with information on how to contact you in case one gets lost accidentally. (Twitter, phone (for example DECT, 29C3 GSM extensions), email, name of the assembly you're well known at, owl, raven)
	- For devices with private information be sure to encrypt them! (TrueCrypt, GPG, FileVault)
	- make note of the filesystem used so you know if they will work on the system of the person you want to exchange data with. (FAT32 is a safe bet to work everywhere.)
	- Mac: NTFS, ZFS, Ext can be read, but not written to without 3rd party software. FAT, ExFAT, HFS+(J), HFSX are fine for current OS X versions.
- Ethernet cords (Cat5e) of multiple lenths. Maybe have a spare to tether a friend.
- Torch (Have spare batteries or rechargables and a matching charger that works with 230V≈ @50Hz)
